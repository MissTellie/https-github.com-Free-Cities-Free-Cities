The leader of your $mercenariesTitle has contacted you from the world outside your arcology. It seems that your mercenaries have enjoyed a profitable series of raids in their time outside the arcology and have hence decided to push their luck by plundering one last location on their way back to the arcology. As your nominal leader, they ask your opinion of a small number of potential targets. Given the distance from the arcology and the time sensitivity of conducting such a mission, you have little to base your decision on besides a brief description.
<br><br>
Worthy of consideration is that although the $mercenariesTitle will enslave the lion's share of enslaved prisoners for the corporation, they will present you the finest slave captured as a gesture of respect for your high position.

Though the soldiers are likely to be untested, they have still received some measure of combat training. Their sergeant is the nominal leader of the group, though she holds the position due to familial connections rather than any real military seniority.
